# Teh Extension

This repository contains the code for a small chrome extension I created called [Teh Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tehextension/nfppnigoflcjodbpkfllkgpmcbbaabfg).

> Tired of always having to correct teh in the? This is the extension for you!
Ever wrote "teh" when you actually wanted to write "the"?
If the answer to this question is "YES!", then this is the extension for you!
Go ahead and give it a try.
